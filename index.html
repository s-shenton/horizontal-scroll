                    <p class="element-body">While LLMs rely on what they learned during training, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) lets the model pull in real-time info from external sources —like a knowledge base — as it responds. It's kind of like giving the AI access to a curated library right before it answers your question.</p>
